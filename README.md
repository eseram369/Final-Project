## Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset

##  Reason to select the topic
#### Heart disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States, affecting millions of people each year and costing the economy a large amount of money. Heart disease kills around 647,000 people in the United States each year, making it the leading cause of death. Plaques forming inside larger coronary arteries, aging-related molecular changes, chronic inflammation, high blood pressure, and diabetes are all causes and risk factors for heart disease.While there are several varieties of coronary heart disease, most people don't realize they have it until they have symptoms like chest pain, a heart attack, or sudden cardiac arrest. This fact emphasizes the necessity of preventative strategies and testing that can effectively forecast heart disease in the population before unfavorable consequences such as myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) occur. 

#### These dataset are retrieved from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/murattademir/heart-disease-binary-classification/notebook). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are three key risk factors for heart disease. At least one of these three risk factors affects around half of Americans. Doctors diagnosed coronary heart disease depend on the many factors  
- Age
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Family History and Genetics
- Lifestyle Habits
- Environment and Occupation

## Description of their source of data
### Content The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual health-related telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study collects responses on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the utilization of prevention strategies healthcare from over 400,000 Americans each year. Since 1984, it's been held yearly. I used a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for 2015 for this project. This original dataset has 330 features and includes responses from 441,455 people. These qualities are either direct questions posed to participants or calculated variables based on their responses. This dataset contains 253,680 survey responses from the cleaned BRFSS 2015, which will be used mostly for binary heart disease categorization. This dataset does not have a notable class imbalance. 229,787 people say they don't have/haven't had heart disease, whereas 23,893 say they have. 

## Questions need to answer
### The following is the question to be investigated:
1. To what extent may BRFSS survey responses be used to forecast the risk of a heart attack? and

2. Can a subset of the BRFSS questions be utilized for preventive care screening, such as heart disease? Acknowledgments It's crucial to note that this dataset is simply a cleaned and consolidated version of the BRFSS 2015 dataset previously on Kaggle.
