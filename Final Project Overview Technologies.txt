Technology used throughout the Project:

Data Cleaning and Analysis.
	We've pulled our dataset through python and will be ETL prior to implement into our database and machine  

Database: 
	Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate the information with Tableau for our dashboard display.

Machine Learning:
	For the ML we are using a mix of panda, Numpy, plotly, plotlyexpress and logistic regress to determine which ML will best fit our project needs.

Dashboard:
	The dashboard will be integrated through Tableau public.
